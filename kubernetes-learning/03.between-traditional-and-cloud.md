1. **Deploy trên 1 OS (truyền thống)**
    - **Hardware**: The physical servers and infrastructure.
    - **Operating System**: The OS installed directly on the hardware.
    - **Applications (App)**: Multiple applications running directly on the OS.
    - **Explanation**: In traditional deployment, applications are deployed directly on a single operating system running on physical hardware. All applications share the same OS and its resources. This method can lead to issues such as resource contention, conflicts between application dependencies, and difficulty in scaling.

2. **Deploy trên máy ảo (thường dùng trên Cloud)**
    - **Hardware**: The physical servers and infrastructure.
    - **Operating System**: The OS installed directly on the hardware.
    - **Hypervisor**: Software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs).
    - **Virtual Machines**: Each VM has its own OS and runs on top of the hypervisor.
    - **Applications (App)**: Applications running inside VMs, each with its own OS and libraries.
    - **Examples**: EC2 (Amazon Web Services), Droplet (DigitalOcean), Compute Engine (Google Cloud Platform).
    - **Explanation**: In this method, the applications are deployed on virtual machines. Each VM includes its own operating system and necessary binaries/libraries. This approach provides better isolation and resource allocation compared to traditional deployment. It's commonly used in cloud environments because it allows for more efficient utilization of hardware resources, easier scaling, and better management of application dependencies.

### Comparison and Benefits

- **Traditional Deployment**:
  - Simpler setup.
  - Direct control over the physical hardware and OS.
  - Potential issues with resource contention and dependency conflicts.

- **Virtual Machine Deployment**:
  - Better isolation between applications.
  - Easier scaling and resource management.
  - More efficient use of hardware resources.
  - Commonly used in cloud environments for its flexibility and scalability.

### Kubernetes Context

In the context of Kubernetes, these methods highlight the evolution of deployment strategies:
- Traditional deployment represents older, monolithic approaches.
- Virtual machine deployment represents the transition to more modern, scalable, and isolated environments, paving the way for containerization and orchestration with Kubernetes.

Kubernetes takes this a step further by abstracting the deployment environment even more, focusing on container orchestration, which provides lightweight, portable, and efficient deployment of applications.

### Summary

This shows illustrates the evolution from traditional deployment on a single OS to deploying applications in virtual machines, especially in cloud environments. It sets the stage for understanding why containerization and orchestration with tools like Kubernetes are beneficial for modern application deployment and management.
